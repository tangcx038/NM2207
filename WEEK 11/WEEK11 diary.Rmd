    Global Food Waste Overview (Map):
        Visualization: Map
        Interaction: Plotly,Hover around the map to explore data.

    Greenhouse Gas Emissions by World (Map):
        Visualization: Interactive map (Plotly)
        Interaction: Click on specific countries to view detailed information (Note: Limited time and technical difficulties hindered full interactivity).

    Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Country (Graph):
        Visualization: Interactive graph
        Interaction: Users can see the percentage of greenhouse gas emissions for specific countries.

    Food Factories Trend in Singapore (Line Chart):
        Visualization: Line Chart
        Interaction: Implement hover effects to display information about each data point, including the amount of waste generated, recycled, and not recycled.

    Amount of Waste Generated, Recycled, and Not Recycled (Interactive Charts):
        Visualization: Interactive Charts
        Interaction: Utilize Shiny to create dynamic filters based on different categories, such as material types.

    Recycling and Wasting Rates in Singapore (Interactive Charts):
        Visualization: Interactive Charts
        Interaction: Use Shiny to create dynamic filters, enabling users to explore recycling and wasting rates based on different categories, such as material types.

    Total Energy Saved from Waste Disposed Instead of Recycling (Doughnut Chart):
        Visualization: Doughnut Chart
        Interaction: Interactive when hovering over each material type.

    Scatter Graph of Total Energy Saved by Year:

Explanation:

    ggplot2, Shiny, Markdown, and Tidyverse were covered in the course and applied to create visualizations and interactive features.
    Interactive chart concepts were taught in Week 6, contributing to the dynamic exploration of data.Further exploration through github and youtube.
    Web development skills, such as creating a dynamic webpage, were self-learnt from youtube, different websites such as hostiger, github, etc during the project.
