```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
Here are some issues when I encounter when cleaning the data 
#Problem Encounter 1
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("problem1.png")
```

Overcome: by typing separate lines instead of just throwing both at the same time.

#Problem Encounter 2
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("problem2.png")
```
Overcome: by typing "waste_energy_stat.csv" instead of "waste_energy_stat(s).csv" --> careless typing

#Problem Encounter 3
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("problem3.png")
```
Overcome: Confirm column names mentioned in the 'rename' and 'mutate' function exist in the CSV. They are also case-sensitive, so make sure there are no typos.

#Problem Encounter 4
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("problem4.png")
```
Overcome: Rearrange the data

Sometimes, if the code has problem and due to limited time, I would manually edit the csv.

Challenges on making the webpages better:


There are many more, however, due to limietd time, I didn't document everything 

But here are some of the error messages i get:

 (1) 
Error in `compute_layer()`:
! `stat_sf()` requires the following missing aesthetics: geometry
Backtrace:
  1. plotly::ggplotly(map, tooltip = c("region", "Food_emissions_by_country"))
  2. plotly:::ggplotly.ggplot(map, tooltip = c("region", "Food_emissions_by_country"))
  3. plotly::gg2list(...)
  4. plotly (local) ggplotly_build(p)
  5. plotly (local) by_layer(function(l, d) l$compute_statistic(d, layout))
     ...
  8. ggplot2 (local) compute_statistic(..., self = self)

 10. ggplot2 (local) compute_layer(..., self = self)

 12. ggplot2 (local) compute_layer(..., self = self)
                                                                                                  
Execution halted

Solution: I tried using the ggplot2 library,  however, i get a followed up issue on [Error in `geom_polygon_interactive()`:! could not find function "geom_polygon_interactive"]. Tried "geom_polygon" line in the ggplot code with "geom_sf". However, I realised the geom_polygon_interactive function is not part of the standard ggplot2 package. 

[Error:! `dsn` must point to a source, not an empty string.
Backtrace:
 1. sf::st_read(system.file("shape/world", package = "maps"), quiet = TRUE)
 2. sf:::st_read.character(...)]
 
 Then there seems there was an issue with attempting to read the shapefile from the maps package. Used the "rnaturalearth" package to obtain a simplified world map. Additionally, use the sf package to handle spatial data. It rendered, but no map is showing. 
 
Then I tried plotly, but when I render, the render took 3 mins and still nothing appear, I concluded it hanged too cause i could not close the Rstudio. 

In the end, I didn't managed to resolve this, as such my second world map does not have interactive elements.


 (2) 
Some of my graph and images are not 100% and centralised.

Solution: At first, i used  theme() function and set the plot.margin parameter, however the graph did not change. I used {r, out.width='100%'} in the end to make it look better. 

 (3) 
 Sometimes I render, it works but most of the times, i render, this error message appear.
 [Error in `add_html_caption()`:]
 
 Solution: Apparently thorugh lots of googling and online conversations, I realised it was due to the unupdated "Quarto" package. 
 
 (4) 
 Some of mmy shiny app also ran into error when publishing onto the wenpage.
[ Error in `checkAppLayout()`:
! Project must not contain both 'app.R' and a single-file Shiny app.
Backtrace:
    ▆
 1. └─rsconnect::deployApp(...)
 2.   └─rsconnect:::appMetadata(...)
 3.     └─rsconnect:::checkAppLayout(appDir, appPrimaryDoc)
 4.       └─cli::cli_abort("Project must not contain both {.file app.R} and a single-file Shiny app.")
 5.         └─rlang::abort(...)
Execution halted]


Solution: Create a separate file and name of the second shiny document.
